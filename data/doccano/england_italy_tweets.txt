    @SpiritByNature @RoyalFamily @pritipatel @England Why does anyone deserve it?? If you've looked that hard you note that lots of people from different walks of life get it. Why did Mark Allen get one or Peter Boorman or Karen Dobson? Do you disagree with their honors? Normal folk just doing their job??

                                 I honestly couldn't care less about who wins tonight. I used to be patriotic but after seeing both the UK and Italy, another country I've visited and loved  freely support the implementation of communism in their countries. I'm no longer patriotic and couldn't give a shit.

I think England is gonna get a goal at the start again.
                                                                                                                           After an exciting start that was, for the neutral, pish. I hoped for a better reaction from Italy but England have them in their pocket. Still, it‚Äôs a game of two halves and all that.

He is highly rated and that‚Äôs why he was picked. If Donarumma had dived the other way it would have been a different story. Unlucky.
                                              Saka, Grealish and Sancho, all subs made way too fucking late. Saka to take the most important penalty as a 19 year old is ridiculous. No Sterling for penalties either? On the bright side Luke Shaw was man of the match and probably England‚Äôs best Euros player.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Saka would have come forward to take a penalty.

                                       Now I get why the abuse rates go up when England plays. They put their sore losing off on the first person they see that they see as some kind of reason why they lost. That poor Italian man did nothing wrong and he just got beaten up. Just for being Italian. The fuck

                                 I honestly couldn't care less about who wins tonight. I used to be patriotic but after seeing both the UK and Italy, another country I've visited and loved  freely support the implementation of communism in their countries. I'm no longer patriotic and couldn't give a shit.

Even Mount has done some good work positionally.   Playing wing backs has proven a brilliant tactical decision.

Even if Saka has said he wants to, he's 19.   Southgate has Sterling &amp; Grealish there to take pens too, and yet doesn't use either of them?!

                                              Saka, Grealish and Sancho, all subs made way too fucking late. Saka to take the most important penalty as a 19 year old is ridiculous. No Sterling for penalties either? On the bright side Luke Shaw was man of the match and probably England‚Äôs best Euros player.

                            Yeah we lost out on pens, would argue it‚Äôs the worst decision Southgate has made is putting the young lads on pens that important. Too much pressure, not enough experience.   But to say Italy deserved that win based on pens is a joke, bad sportsmanship the whole game from them.

                                       Now I get why the abuse rates go up when England plays. They put their sore losing off on the first person they see that they see as some kind of reason why they lost. That poor Italian man did nothing wrong and he just got beaten up. Just for being Italian. The fuck

If you recognise anyone in this crowd of thugs, I suggest you let their employer know how they behave after a couple of shandies. Disgraceful thuggery.

                                 I honestly couldn't care less about who wins tonight. I used to be patriotic but after seeing both the UK and Italy, another country I've visited and loved  freely support the implementation of communism in their countries. I'm no longer patriotic and couldn't give a shit.

I think England is gonna get a goal at the start again.

I hoped for a better reaction from Italy but England have them in their pocket. Still, it‚Äôs a game of two halves and all that.

                                              Saka, Grealish and Sancho, all subs made way too fucking late. Saka to take the most important penalty as a 19 year old is ridiculous. No Sterling for penalties either? On the bright side Luke Shaw was man of the match and probably England‚Äôs best Euros player.

                            Yeah we lost out on pens, would argue it‚Äôs the worst decision Southgate has made is putting the young lads on pens that important. Too much pressure, not enough experience.   But to say Italy deserved that win based on pens is a joke, bad sportsmanship the whole game from them.
