2021-07-11T22:25:33Z,"Italy well deserved"
2021-07-11T22:26:04Z,"Italy played way too dirty &amp; did not deserve that win at all imo"
2021-07-11T22:26:04Z,"Now I get why the abuse rates go up when England plays. They put their sore losing off on the first person they see that they see as some kind of reason why they lost. That poor Italian man did nothing wrong and he just got beaten up. Just for being Italian. The fuck"
2021-07-11T22:26:15Z,"England boutta declare war on Italy 💀"
2021-07-11T22:26:56Z,"The end to that England - Italy game really sums up England's problems in a nutshell doesn't it?
