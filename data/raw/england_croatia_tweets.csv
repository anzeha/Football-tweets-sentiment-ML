2021-06-13T15:47:02Z,"I know why England are so disliked, for many years I found it very difficult to support them in football.

However, the moving of the goalposts every time England win a match these days by those who are desperate for England to lose is pretty funny."
2021-06-13T15:47:02Z,"@DylanSchwartz Plays the side best for the game, grealish etc will feature against Scotland I imagine"
2021-06-13T15:47:25Z,"@honeamwine Playing at Wembley is a massive advantage Belguim DONT have a better squad than England they have KDB Lukaku and Hazard which are great but everything after that is far behind them three 
Players England have better squad than them."
2021-06-13T15:47:56Z,"@Jesudian15 @England @bt_uk Well we don’t if we are winning"
2021-06-13T15:48:04Z,"Get ready for the next wave of falsehoods and poppycock. In the end, they will more power and wealth, and you will have less freedom and less money. 

For your safety of course."
2021-06-13T15:48:07Z,"@jamosfoundation @England @EURO2020 @HNS_CFF @wembleystadium Mad they didn’t send you the goalie kit really."
2021-06-13T15:49:03Z,"Declan Rice along with Kane was the worst player on the pitch."
2021-06-13T15:49:03Z,"@Nick11LUFC @TWLUFC @England Far too easy to upset you bunch of snowflakes 🤣🤣"
2021-06-13T15:49:11Z,"England were far from impressive today... The team selection was awful also and they couldn't create goalscoring opportunity

Southgate has a lot of work to do"
2021-06-13T15:49:12Z,"I can't wait for the Match Croatia vs England, it's going to have a full of thrilling match.

2021-06-13T15:49:19Z,"@Revolution_IRL #Kane gets stage fright when he plays for England. Obvious again today to a blind man. Great club player, best in England."
2021-06-13T15:49:31Z,"@rgbvex The FA isn't responsible for what other countries do. The first game of international football was played between England and Scotland.

Other state's could organise their football federations the same way, if they chose. I don't see why we should have to change."
2021-06-13T15:49:32Z,"@jordan_3b But if we have to say it’s just one country, why would this definition of a nation not also apply? How can we not be a country but be a nation - this definition pretty much sums of people of Scotland and England collectively https://t.co/zzdSBJANko"

2021-06-13T15:51:01Z,"@Budgiekiller @derek_rocholl @England You’re telling me that if the England players stood on the centre circle and all did the black power salute more fans would be okay with it? 

Genuinely?"
2021-06-13T15:51:12Z,"@NicoleHolliday @England Its coming home😂🤩❤️"

2021-06-13T15:51:20Z,"@KeiranJinks @EugeneK12170568 @CoreyMFC @England Yeah, that tweet is probably gonna backfire on me now when Scotland clinch a win 😂"
2021-06-13T15:51:22Z,"Austria should dominate possession, so I really can't see Alaba staying back if they are camped in the North Macedonia half. He roams. It's what he does. 

We'll soon see.

2021-06-13T15:59:09Z,"@DartsDifferent @Stevebi27465893 @JMikeStubbs @FA @England Nobody is denying the message. It is the gesture that is the problem. Change the gesture and the boos become cheers. How difficult is it to understand that a tiny change would end the whole division? Continuing that particular gesture facilitates division; it is that simple."
